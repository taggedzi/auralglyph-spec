# AuralGlyph Governance

AuralGlyph is currently in a pre-1.0 design phase.  
During this stage, the project follows a **benevolent stewardship model**.

## Stewardship Model (Pre-1.0)

- **Primary steward:** @taggedzi (Matthew Craig)
- Major changes require steward approval
- Community participation is encouraged
- Minor editorial PRs may be merged by maintainers

## Post-1.0 Future Governance

Once the project reaches version 1.0, governance may transition to a community
working group model, including:

- Multi-person technical steering committee
- Consensus-based decision processes
- Working groups for transforms, metadata, and reference implementations

## Goals of Governance

- Maintain clarity and coherence of the specification
- Avoid fragmentation or incompatible forks
- Provide legal and IP safety for all contributors
- Ensure long-term openness and neutrality
